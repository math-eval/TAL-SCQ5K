## Dataset Description

### Dataset Summary

TAL-SCQ5K-EN/TAL-SCQ5K-CN are high quality mathematical competition datasets in English and Chinese language created by TAL Education Group, each consisting of 5K questions(3K training and 2K testing). The questions are in the form of multiple-choice and cover mathematical topics at the primary,junior high and high school levels. In addition, detailed solution steps are provided to facilitate CoT training and all the mathematical expressions in the questions have been presented as standard text-mode Latex.

## Usage

Each of the above datasets is located in a separate sub-directory. To load an individual subset, use the data_dir argument of the load_dataset() function as follows:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load all subsets (share the same schema)
dataset = load_dataset("math-eval/TAL-SCQ5K")

# Load TAL-SCQ5K-EN
dataset = load_dataset("math-eval/TAL-SCQ5K", data_dir="TAL-SCQ5K-EN")

# Load TAL-SCQ5K-CN
dataset = load_dataset("math-eval/TAL-SCQ5K", data_dir="TAL-SCQ5K-CN")

```
